However, most page refreshes will require cached data to be refetched from one or more web service - maximum cache time is between one hour and 12 hours, due to restrictions on caching imposed by web service providers.\r\n\r\nStill, the results are very consistent, only limited by the accuracy of UPC data provided by third parties - at an estimate, less than 1% of UPC searches have products with wrongly-allocated UPCs."

The Tumblr search only lets me find posts that have all three tags so I would have to make three separate searches.\n\nWith Explorr you can perform those three (or two, or five or more) searches simultaneously.\n\nHTTPS version is also available and the URL gets updated with the tags you searched for, so you can easily bookmark the page.\n\nFor more detailed description and example usage visit http://blog.fourtonfish.com/tagged/tumblr-tag-explorr\n\nNote: This is an early beta and the app may feel a bit clunky, but I am slowly working on polishing it.\n"

        "mashup_desc": "oTube is a mobile subscription service that allows people to receive notifications via text message (SMS/MMS) each time a new video is published to a YouTube channel. We created moTube as a way for people to get realtime updates from their favorite YouTube channels directly on their phone.\n\nIt's a free service and we don't charge subscribers for the notifications sent to their device. Keep in mind that the text messaging plan you have with your mobile carrier still applies. For example, if you have an unlimited messaging plan and receive an update from moTube, you will not be charged anything.\n\nmoTube is currently in beta, so YouTubers who want to add moTube to their channel must have an invite which we're currently accepting requests for on our website (http://motube.us/)."

With an average charge for each ED encounter approaching $700 vs. the average physician office charge of $150, every patient redirected away from the ED saves the payor $550. This represents a total potential market savings of $34 billion for facilitating correct use of primary care. \n\nProviding people with the tools they need to find appropriate care everywhere saves everyone, hospitals and patients, money and time.\n\nPatients receive a SMS from triage.me post emergency room discharge. By sending a text to triage.me with their problem and current address, we route the person towards the nearest clinic, providing the address and a link to directions (for smartphone users).\n\nMany clinics that work with the underinsured also often have variable hours and locations. We've made it easy for these clinics to update their hours and location via SMS so that we can better route triage.me users to locations."

The site uses Ajax to change the layout and works with as little clicks as possible, we also built the mashup to display hundreds of apartment/house pins on the map without compromising performance. Rent Compass also developed the first Canadian apartment rentals search applications for mobile devices; namely the iPhone, iPad and Google Android. Since we are obsessed with performance we made our mobile apps super fast as well, with focus on ease of usability. That's why our users love them and give great reviews.\nWe also license our platform to other industries or geographic locations."

If both users say \"yes\", the connection stays open and they can talk on MiniDat.es for as long as they want.
